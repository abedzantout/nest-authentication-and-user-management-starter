- Powerful Nest API out of the box
- Built-in powerful authentication and user management APIs
- User invitation
- MongoDB and Mongoose Integration
- Optimized for speed and scalability
- Postman file included for easy testing
- HMR integration
- Security integration out of the box

## Stack

- [Nest Js 7+](https://www.nestjs.com)
- Typescript
- Node JS
- MongoDB and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/)

# Security
The project implements some of nodejs [security techniques](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/security) :
- [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) : can help protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately
- [Express Rate Limit](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit): to protect your applications from brute-force attacks
  - In the main.ts you can set a limit of requests in a time window (default is 100 requests in 15 minutes for all endpoints, and 3 requests in a 1 hour for sign up endpoint)
